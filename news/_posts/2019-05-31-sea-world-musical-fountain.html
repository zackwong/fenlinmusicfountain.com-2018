It is the largest and 360-degree panoramic view of the water show in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>The water show design is inspired by two aspects:</p>
<p>The first is the Pisces spirit, which mainly uses the projection of the Pisces building in the C area of the sea world in the water. Let the entity Pisces echo the illusory Pisces, and it will be true and illusory.</p>
<p>The second is the sea spray, which uses curves to symbolize the ship's route to the sea. The circles on both sides symbolize the giant ship riding the wind and waves at sea, causing numerous waves.</p>

<p>The main person in charge of Zhongke Waterview Company introduced the reporter:</p>
<p>The “Musical Fountain” project of the Sea World is a project for the “Water Fountain New Standard” for the water fountain industry. The most important difference compared with other music fountain projects is that the “Music Fountain” of the Sea World emphasizes the water show from beginning to end. The core of the performance is “the dance of water”, not just the shape, height and shape of the water column according to the rhythm, melody and pitch of the music. Let the "water dance" become the core of the water show, this sentence also defines the "new standard of music fountain", it will "water dance" with sound, light, fog, video and other performance elements, along with The musical theme develops a process of deducting a story and shaping an artistic image. Using the precision and high-end technology, the “Sea World” water show expresses the elegance and beauty of the dance, which arouses people's emotions of contemplation, sigh and surprise!</p>
<p>He also introduced to reporters the technological and artistic content behind the wonderful "water dance" performance. The "Integrated Water Dance Creation System" developed by them is a science and technology project supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology Fund. The system is the core structure of the entire music fountain. It is jointly developed by the company led by the Institute of Automation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Hydraulics Laboratory of Tsinghua University, and the Tianjin Ballet. It completely solved the technical problems that the music fountain field could not be freely combined with choreography and could not be dynamically corrected in real time. At the same time, he also said that the company's self-developed equipments have national patent certificates and control systems for independently developing software copyrights and “water”. The "art dance" art creation process has reached the international advanced level. It is fully capable of representing China in the international waterscape design market competition. With these advantages, the team has repeatedly won many international waterscape design bidding competitions, and then the company's goal It is to make the "water dance" performance into a cultural industry, to become an art industry, and to participate in international competition with "China's wisdom".</p>
