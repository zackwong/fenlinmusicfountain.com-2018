<p>Implementation of a non musical show. Musical fountains usually run without music, music just sounds for specific events. For non-musical fountains and <a href="{{ site.url }}">musical fountains</a> operating without music, we define a show where water features are not supported by music, but the jets and lighting are synchronize themselves. This show will be repeated cyclically while the fountain is operating. It will be long enough so that the viewer is unable to remember the sequence.</p>

To do this, the software, based on a common time line to the music, lights and jets (pumps, frequency converters, or solenoid valves), developing operating sequences that will make all the components synchronized and totally coordinated.</p>
