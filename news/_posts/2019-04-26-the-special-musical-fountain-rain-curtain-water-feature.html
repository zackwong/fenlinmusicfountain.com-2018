<p>WHERE THE WATER OF RAIN CURTAIN GOES?</p>
<p>Specially designed troughs are used to collect the water falling from a height through the strands of rain curtains. In fact, the whole system is a kind of closed system. The water collected in the trough is pumped to the top of the curtain to fall again through it. It can be used suitably indoors because it keeps it dry as very few droplets are supposed to fall on the floor in the whole process.</p>
