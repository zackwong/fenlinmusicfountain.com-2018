<p> We are collectively called fountains, but we don't know that fountains are subdivided into many types. Today, we are going to introduce sparkling fountains.</p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="/images/news/{{ page.image }}-1.jpg" alt="{{ page.keywords }}"></p>
<p>Fountains are probably the most enthusiastic way to create waterscape. Whether it is an ornamental water fountain or a fountain with interesting interaction with people, it will be a very eye-catching existence in the landscape.</p>
<p>The capacity of a fountain pump is usually calculated in flow liters per hour (LPH). Large pumps are measured in watts (W). The manufacturer will provide a chart showing the corresponding fountain pump size and power as the head and flow increase. Because some pumps have been marked with flow, other fountain pumps only give letters or numbers, which requires reference to the chart.</p>
<p>If you want to determine how much water pump your waterfall project needs, you must first estimate the vertical height from the top of the fountain pump to the top of the waterfall. Note that some designers estimate the height from the top of the pool water. If the fountain pump is installed 60cm underwater, there will be a difference of 60cm in head. For large projects, the difference in water flow will be small, but it will be affected in small projects.</p>
<p>In waterscape design, the control of the capacity of the fountain pump often determines whether a project works normally.</p>
