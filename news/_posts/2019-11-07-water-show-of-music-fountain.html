title: Water Show of Music Fountain
description: The musical fountain, which is not only attracting more and more people, but also can humidified air, reduce dust, release our pressure and so on.

<p> <a href="{{ site.url }}" target="_blank">musical fountain</a> is controlled by the music rhythm. When music pitch high, fountain splashing the water column on the high, the air are all filled with water mist. When low pitch, fountain splashing the water column is low. If the music suddenly stopped, In the air of the water column will be violent to fall, splashing water, wet onlookers of the clothes, but people still reluctant to leave.</p>
<p>Music fountain with the ups and downs of the music, sometimes high, sometimes low, sometimes majestic, sometimes moderate… the water spray out of the colorful, yellow, red, blue, green, and pink, very beautiful and spectacular. The shape of the musical fountain is also varied. Some like a staggered arch bridge, some like a straight pillar, and some like open flowers. Whenever the fountain accompanied the music to show to people its magic and charming style, many visitors are happily watching, linger.</p>
<p>When the sprayed water falls, the river will be rippling in a circle of ripples, people will feel like there’s a paradise on the earth!</p>

<p>Also ,water quality in music fountains is also very important for the music fountain.  For the proper functioning of Fountains and for their component parts to provide a good performance along the years, it is important to use the right water in order to prevent failures and a rapid wear of the parts that make up the Fountain. As a general rule the water must have the same cleanness, clearness and acidity characteristics and the same calcium proportion as safe drinking water.</p>
<p>1.The pH must be between 7.2 and 7.6</p>
<p>2.The impurity content of any kind must not be over 50 g per m3 of water.</p>
<p>3.The water hardness must not be over 180 mg of Ca Co3 per 1 liter of water.</p>
<p>4.The chlorine amount must be under 125 mg per 1 liter of water.</p>
<p>5.The water temperature must be between +5ºC (41ºF) and +35ºC (95ºF)</p>
<p>Water pH</p>
<p>This detail, which is usually not known and is barely mentioned, is often the reason for many of the Fountains’ component parts –electro-pumps, nozzles, submersible lights, pipes, etc.- to get intensely corroded and eventually stop functioning in a time frame shorter than a year. This is because most of these parts are made of Bronze, Brass, 304 stainless steel, etc., metals which do not tolerate high acidity. Water is considered neutral when its pH is of 7 – if the pH is over 7 it is considered alkaline water.</p>
<p>PH is an abbreviation of potential hydrogen and the normal scale of value can be between 0 and 14, being 7 the value of a neutral solution such as water. If the value is between 0 and 7 the solution will be considered acid, while if it is between 7 and 14 it will be considered basic (or alkaline). A good way to make an approximate pH measurement is by using a test strip, also known as litmus paper strip. When put into water, the paper strip changes its color so it can be compared with a scale of colors printed outside the packaging. Each color indicates the pH quite accurately. The price of these tests is usually not higher than $1.</p>
<p>Analyzer test kits for pools are also quite reliable. They provide quite approximate values and are not expensive.</p>
<p>In general, when the pH value is over 8 water gets cloudy and can promote deposits in Pipes, Nozzles, etc. It can cause irritation of eyes, ears, nose and throat too. Also, if the pH value is over 8 there is no point in adding chlorine to water as such high pH value will prevent it from acting.</p>

<p>Impurities in water</p>
<p>If the water shows a high impurity content (+ than 50 gr/m3), this fact will cause deposits and blockages at the jet-outlet nozzles (especially in those with small diameter) and the pump impeller, where they are constantly deposited. So their performance will suffer and the output current will be reduced. So it is advisable that the water of the Architectural Fountains gets filtered, just like the water of a pool. For its maintenance it is good to add a flint-sand Filter or a similar device that can filter all the water in less than 4 hours, on a daily basis. As these Fountains’ total water volume is small (they are not very deep), the water Purifier can be a small low-price unit which will yet make it possible to have clean, clear and impurity-free water. It is advisable to leave an electrical outlet in the Fountain’s bottom in order to connect a cleaning device that will absorb the bottom dirt.</p>
<p>Water hardness</p>
<p>Water can be classified by its hardness, on the basis of the calcium and magnesium-salts amount that contains. This contain is always measured in Ca Co3 mg per 1 liter of water à (mg/ liter CaCo3).</p>
<p>In Fountains it is not advisable to use water with hardness over 90 mg/liter Ca Co3 (moderately hard water).</p>
<p>Thus, in the following table the mg/l correspond to Ca Co3,If the water used in the Fountains is hard or very hard, it will cause salt deposits in the submarine lights and therefore they will provide less light with the same energy expenditure. It will also promote calcium deposits in the screw-in connectors of the pipes, Nozzles, etc. so they will be more difficult to change or repair. These salts are especially harmful for the inside of Pumps, Pipes, Electro-Pumps etc., where salt deposits will block the water access, consequentially decreasing the flow and the operating pressures. This can lead to an eventual breakage of the elements.</p>
