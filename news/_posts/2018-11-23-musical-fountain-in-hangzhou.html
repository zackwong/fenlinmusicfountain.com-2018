<p>Plan your Hangzhou tour? As important as a walk around West Lake in the early morning, a stroll along West Lake in the evening is equally worth your time. I walk from our lodging hotel in the evening along the famous Nanshan Road Bar Street. soon I find myself standing on the west bank of West Lake abutting the downtown of Hangzhou. To be exact, I’m standing on the Third Park on the west bank of West Lake.</p>
<p>The west bank of West Lake has an official Chinese name – 湖傧(Hubin, or lakeside). Hubin or the lakeside comprises six parks, namely First Park, Second Park, Third Park, Fourth Park, Fifth Park and Sixth Park. The popular West Lake Musical Water fountain is located in the third park of Hubin (Lakeside).</p>
<p>Part of the Hubin is a pedestrian street and part has a wide sidewalk rife with domestic and foreign commercial brands.</p>
