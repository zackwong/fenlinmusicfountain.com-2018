<p>The water pressure is generally a pump. After years of development, it has gradually developed into several categories: <a href="{{ site.url }}" target="_blank">musical fountain</a> and program-controlled fountains. ; Music + program-controlled fountains; laser water screen movies; fun fountains, etc., plus specific lights, control systems, to purify the air and beautify the environment, the fountain was originally a natural landscape, is the ground outcrop of pressured water. The fountain in the garden is generally a decorative water-spraying device built manually for the purpose of landscaping. The fountain can moisten the surrounding air, reduce dust, and lower the temperature. The tiny water droplets of the fountain collide with air molecules to produce a large amount of negative oxygen ions. Therefore, the fountain is beneficial to improve the city's appearance and improve residents' physical and mental health.</p>
<p>1. Application and Type</p>
<p>Fountain is one of the most common garden water features, widely used in indoor and outdoor spaces, such as city squares, public buildings or as sketches of buildings and gardens. Not only is it an independent artwork, but it can increase the air humidity in the local space, reduce dust, and greatly increase the concentration of negative oxygen ions in the air, which is also beneficial to improving the environment and improving people's physical and mental health.</p>
<p>There are many types of fountains, which can be roughly divided into: ordinary decorative fountains, fountains combined with sculptures, water sculptures, automatic control fountains, etc. Under normal circumstances, the location of the fountain is mostly set at the focal point or end point of the axis of the building or square. You can also make some small scenes of the fountain according to the characteristics of the environment to freely decorate the indoor and outdoor spaces. The fountain should be placed in a sheltered environment to maintain the water type.</p>
<p>The forms of fountain pools are natural and whole. The location of the water spray can be in the center of the pool, or it can be offset to one side or freely arranged. The form and scale of the water spray and the proportion of the size of the water fountain should be determined according to the spatial scale of the fountain.</p>

<p>2. The location of the fountain in different environments</p>
<p>Open spaces, such as the front of the station and the entrance of the park, etc., the fountain pool is mostly in the form of a large pool with high water spray, and the lighting is not too gorgeous;</p>
<p>Narrow venues, such as street turns, etc., the fountain pool is mostly rectangular;</p>
<p>In the traditional garden, the fountain pool is mostly natural water spray, which can be made into falling water, springs, etc., mainly to express the natural water state;</p>
<p>The lively places, such as some small parts of the park, have free-form fountains and can be combined with various decorative pieces such as sculptures, and generally should not be changed too much.</p>
<p>3. The height and diameter of the water spray</p>
<p>According to the physiological characteristics of the visual field of the human eye, for landscapes such as fountains, sculptures, and flower beds, the vertical viewing angle is 30 degrees, and the horizontal viewing angle is within a range of 45 degrees. The suitable sight distance of the fountain is 3.3 times the height of the water spray. Of course, there is the effect of shortening the viewing distance, causing the effect of looking up. The radius of the pool and the height of the water head of the fountain should have a certain ratio. Generally, the radius of the pool is 1.5 times the height of the fountain. If the radius is too small, the water drops are easy to splash. In order to make the water spray lines obvious, dark scenes should be used as the background.</p>

<p>However, there are many fountain landscape water bodies in China that have different degrees of water quality deterioration, especially the accumulation of organic matter, phosphorus, nitrogen and other substances in the water body will promote the rapid reproduction of algae, and the algae will consume water in the process of reproduction and growth. The oxygen makes the water eutrophication. The reason for the eutrophication is that the landscape water body is not equipped with water treatment facilities, and a considerable part of the fountain waterscape project does not install water treatment equipment in order to save investment, so it does not meet the water quality of the third and fourth types of landscape water specified in the regulations. standard. Although these projects have beautified the environment as a whole, they have caused pollution to the environment on the other hand.</p>
