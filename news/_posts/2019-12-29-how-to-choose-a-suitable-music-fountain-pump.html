<p>The <a href="{{ site.url }}">musical fountain</a> is an artificially shaped or natural spring pond, which sprays beautiful water for people to watch. The fountain is an important part of the garden. In modern gardens, in addition to the plant landscape, the fountain is also an important landscape. It is not only a kind of waterscape art, it reflects the combination of dynamic and static, forming a bright and lively atmosphere, giving people a beautiful enjoyment; at the same time, the fountain can also increase Negative ion content plays a role in purifying the air, increasing the humidity of the air, and lowering the ambient temperature, so it is deeply loved by people.</p>
<p> With the continuous improvement of the living standards of our people, urban construction has attracted more and more attention. Landscape architects have gradually become independent from landscape and garden design, urban planning and design, and have become a new profession. Compared with the drastic urban planning, the skill of the landscape designer lies in the meticulous care of the urban environment. The artificial fountain is one of the most representative works in the urban landscape. The artificial fountain I made this time was designed after careful observation and summary of several artificial fountains in tourist places. Can bring a more beautiful enjoyment to the human visual system.</p>

<p>For a waterscape project, the fountain pump is like the heart of the waterscape project, so whether the capacity configuration of the fountain pump meets the needs of the waterscape project will directly affect the high-speed water supply and fountain operation efficiency, and even the normal operation of the entire waterscape project.</p>
<p>The capacity of a fountain pump is usually calculated in flow liters per hour (LPH). Large pumps are measured in watts (W). The manufacturer will provide a chart showing the corresponding fountain pump size and power as the head and flow increase. Because some pumps have been marked with flow, other fountain pumps only give letters or numbers, which requires reference to the chart.</p>
<p>If you want to determine how much water pump your waterfall project needs, you must first estimate the vertical height from the top of the fountain pump to the top of the waterfall. Note that some designers estimate the height from the top of the pool water. If the fountain pump is installed 60cm underwater, there will be a difference of 60cm in head. For large projects, the difference in water flow will be small, but it will be affected in small projects.</p>
<p>In waterscape design, the control of the capacity of the fountain pump often determines whether a project works normally.</p>
