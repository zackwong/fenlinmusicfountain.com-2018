keywords: musical fountain
description: The article mainly talks about several frequent questions about the dancing water musical fountain.  
---
<p>Can a <a href="{{ site.url }}" target="_blank">musical fountain</a> be associated with a Water Screen or an Aquavision Water Curtain?</p>
<p>All our water effects can be combined to propose a complete water show.</p>
<p>Can a Musical Fountain be installed indoor?</p>
<p>The water jets of our Musical Fountains have adjustable heights for indoor use, and the size of our pools will be adapted to avoid any splashing.</p>
<p>Can the Musical Fountain be installed in a lake?</p>
<p>The Magic of Water musical fountains are not floating, unlike some of our Water Theaters; you will thus have to provide us with an underwater structure that enables its installation in the lake.</p>
<p>Can the Musical Fountain work automatically?</p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="/images/news/{{ page.image }}-1.jpg" alt="{{ page.keywords }}"></p>
<p>All our water shows can be pre-encoded and operate fully automatically; our control equipment can also integrate a scheduler to launch shows at your convenience all day long.</p>
<p>How long does a water show with the Musical Fountain last?</p>
We recommend a duration of 5 to 20 minutes for a Musical Fountain show alone; the duration can be extended if other performances are combined (orchestra, performances of actors/dancers, fireworks, movies ...).</p>
<p>Can we play the Musical Fountain by daytime?</p>
<p>The Musical Fountain can play by daytime; however, the water jets of this fountain are very fine and the good visibility cannot be guaranteed according to the surrounding luminosity.</p>
<p>What is the size of a Musical Fountain?</p>
<p>The size of our Musical Fountains varies according to the configuration of the site and the wish of the client.</p>
