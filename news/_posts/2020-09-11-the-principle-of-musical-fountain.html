title: The principle of musical fountain 
description: Today's musical fountains rely on artificial landscaping fountains with fountain equipment, control frequency converter to achieve a sense of rhythm.

<p>The water form of the <a href="{{ site.url }}" target="_blank">musical fountain</a> is varied, the light gives people a real and intuitive sense of beauty, and the various swings in the musical fountain can make people feel the flexibility of the fountain.
<p>The change of the position and speed of the swinging fountain is an important factor in producing the color of the swing. The position sensor of the swinging mechanism of the fountain should be a waterproof non-contact positioning device. Generally, a magnet-induced Hall sensor, a photoelectric sensor guided by an optical fiber, or a rotary position encoder attracted by a magnet is used.</p>
<p>The positioning accuracy of the shaking mechanism is affected by the movement torque and the resistance torque. The movement torque is determined by the power supply voltage of the motor and the movement speed before stopping. The resistance torque is composed of the friction force of the shaking mechanism, the water flow speed, and the surrounding wind force. These factors cannot be predetermined.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to achieve the purpose of positioning. We must change its control parameters once, usually there are two control parameters to locate the motor dynamic braking. For the magnitude of the DC braking current and the starting braking time, the more convenient way to control the computer is to change the braking time.The design of fountain equipment and technical content, the design of fountain engineering is not an easy task. Frequently seen fountains are carefully designed by engineers, high radiation matching height, colorful fountains, and visual perception of colors. The fountain should be distributed and artistic charm, the music fountain waterscape is the main public square, the park square. Now it has advanced production of more fountains, and now musical fountains have attracted more attention.In some of the larger square fountains, you can see the fountains are scattered by gradually shining light at night, plus some changes in the spring constant. In different ways, add charm to the city. With the development of science and technology, fountains are now changing, including forms and shapes. The big feature of the fountain is that it can purify the air, humidify and remove dust. Various hydraulic modes can be changed automatically. This will not only give the favorite city, but also make people feel more relaxed and natural pressure. All in all, the development of fountains will continue for a long time.</p>
<p>There are many classifications of waterscape fountain equipment, and various fountains have appeared in social science and technology. The speed of development has been widely used in the development of the construction field. The stone fountain is a major feature. Genius stone is the raw material and is finely processed. A beautiful stone fountain sculpture, stone fountain, fountain, due to unique materials, fountains with metal materials have a more natural feeling. It is beautiful, and the fountain is carved by hand with a number carved on the edge of the basin. A richer sense of beauty meets people's aesthetic needs.</p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="/images/news/{{ page.image }}-1.jpg" alt="{{ page.keywords }}"></p>
<p>The fountain landscape can be broadly divided into two categories:</p>
<p>The first is to adapt measures to local conditions, according to the topographic structure of the site, imitating natural waterscapes, such as wall springs, springs, mist springs, pipes, streams, waterfalls, water curtains, falling water, water waves, swirling nests, etc.;</p>
<p>The second is to rely entirely on artificial landscaping with fountain equipment. There are musical fountains, program-controlled fountains, swing fountains, running fountains, bright fountains, amusement fountains, super high fountains, laser water curtain movies, etc.</p>
<p>Types of fountains</p>
<p>There are many types and forms of fountains, which can be roughly divided into the following four categories:</p>
<p>1. Ordinary decorative fountain is a fixed water spray fountain composed of various ordinary splash patterns.</p>
<p>2. The fountain combined with sculptures. The various water spray flower shapes of the fountain, sculptures, water trays, ornamental columns, etc. form the landscape together.</p>
<p>3. Water Sculpture Artificially or mechanically shape various abstract or concrete water spray shapes, the water shape takes the shape of a certain artistic "shape".</p>
<p>4. The self-control fountain is to use various electronic technologies to control the changes of water, light, sound and color according to the design procedure, thereby forming a strange and varied water scene.</p>
<p>The layout of the fountain</p>
<p>Regular fountain pools are often used in open areas. The pool should be large, the spray water should be high, and the lighting should not be too gorgeous. For narrow and long venues, such as street corners, in front of buildings, etc., the pool is mostly rectangular. The pools next to modern residential buildings are mostly round or rectangular. The water volume of the fountain should be large, the sense of water should be strong, and the lighting can be more gorgeous. The form of the fountain is free and can be combined with various decorative pieces such as sculptures, but the changes should be simple and the colors should be simple.</p>
<p>When choosing the location of the fountain and arranging the environment around the fountain, the theme and form of the fountain must first be considered. The determined theme and form must be in harmony with the environment. The fountain and the environment should be considered together, and the environment should be rendered and contrasted with the fountain to achieve The purpose of decorating the environment, or creating artistic conception with the help of the artistic association of a specific fountain.</p>
<p>1. Location</p>
<p>Generally, it is mostly set in the axis focus, end point or flower bed group of the courtyard. According to the environmental characteristics, some small fountain scenes can be made, and they can be arranged in the courtyard, on both sides of the door, at the turning point of the space, in the hall of public buildings and other places. The arrangement, freely decorate indoor and outdoor spaces. But pay attention to the layout, do not arrange the fountain in the air duct between the buildings, but should be placed in a sheltered environment, so as not to blow by the strong wind, the water shape of the fountain is broken and the falling water is blown out of the pool.</p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="/images/news/{{ page.image }}-2.jpg" alt="{{ page.keywords }}"></p>
<p>2. Form</p>
<p>There are two types of natural and regular water spray positions that can be located in the center of the pool to form a pattern, or they can be placed on one side or freely arranged. Secondly, the form and scale of the water spray and the proportion of the fountain must be determined according to the spatial scale of the fountain.</p>
<p>3. the type of fountain nozzle</p>
<p>The sprinkler is the main component of the fountain, it determines the spraying posture. Its function is to pass the water with a certain pressure through the shape of the nozzle to form various expected and gorgeous water shapes. At present, the nozzle styles frequently used at home and abroad include single jet nozzles, water mist nozzles, ring nozzles, rotating nozzles, fan nozzles, porous nozzles, deformed nozzles, dandelion nozzles, suction nozzles, combined nozzles and other nozzles.</p>
<p>4. the water type design of the fountain water supply and drainage system</p>
<p>The water type of the fountain is caused by various factors such as different types of nozzles, different combinations of nozzles, and different angles of the nozzles. In terms of the composition of the fountain water type, its basic elements are the different types produced by different forms of sprinklers, namely, water column, hose, water line, water curtain, water film, water mist, blisters, etc. There are also many ways to combine water types, such as water column, waterline parallel, direct, oblique, overhead, down shot, waterline cross jet, relative jet, radial jet, rotary jet, or water The thread passes through the water curtain and water film, the sprinkler is covered by the water mist, and the water splash is clicked on the water surface.</p>
<p>5. Control method of fountain</p>
<p>There are three main ways to control the spray water volume, spray time, and spray pattern change of the fountain.</p>
<p>1) Hand valve control. This is the most common and simplest control method. A manual control valve is installed on the water supply pipe of the fountain to adjust the pressure and flow of the water in each pipe section to form a fixed water spray.</p>
<p>2) Relay control. Usually, a time relay is used to control the opening and closing of water pumps, solenoid valves, colored lights, etc. according to the design time program, so as to realize the automatic change of water spray posture.</p>
<p>3) Sound control. The voice-activated fountain is a self-controlled fountain that uses the body sound to control the change of the water shape of the fountain. The principle of the sound-controlled fountain is to convert the sound signal into an electric signal, after amplification and other processing, push the relay or its electronic switch, and then control the opening and closing of the solenoid valve located on the waterway, so as to control the on and off of the water flow of the nozzle . In this way, as the sound changes, people can see changes in the size, height and shape of the spray. It can combine people's hearing and vision, and the water spray from the fountain dances with the beautiful melody of the music.</p>
<p>6. Water supply method of fountain.</p>
<p>Only direct water supply from tap water and circulating water supply with submersible pump. Place the submersible pump in a relatively hidden or low place in the spray pool, and directly pump the pool water to the spray pipe and nozzle to circulate water. Generally suitable for small fountains.</p>
<p>7. Layout of fountain pipes.</p>
<p>The pipes of large-scale waterscape projects can be arranged in dedicated pipe trenches or shared trenches. The pipes of general waterscape projects can be directly laid in the pool. In order to keep the water pressure of each nozzle consistent, it is advisable to adopt ring-shaped piping or symmetrical piping, and minimize the head loss. Each nozzle or group of nozzles should be equipped with a valve to adjust the water pressure. For high-range sprinklers, try to keep a long straight pipe section or install a rectifier in front of the sprinkler.</p>
<p>8. fountain design and construction matters needing attention</p>
<p>The method of the fountain pool bottom and pool wall should be based on the specific conditions, and then make special design after mechanical calculation. For the material of the water-proof layer of the pool bottom and wall, the coiled materials with better waterproof effect should be selected, such as EPDM waterproof cloth and chlorinated polyethylene waterproofing coiled materials. The water inlet, overflow, and pump pit of the pool should be set up in a relatively hidden place in the pool. The location of the pump pit and the location of the pipe should be close to the power source and water source. In winter freezing areas, various pool bottom and pool wall practices require consideration of draining out of the pool in winter. Therefore, the drainage facilities of the pool must be easy to control manually.</p>
