<p>First, determine which parts of the <a href="{{ site.url }}" target="_blank">musical fountain</a> light need to be illuminated and master the visual shape and type of illumination around the fountain. If you need color, then another lighting must not over-bright or weaken the color effect. Before designing an underwater fountain LED light, it is necessary to clarify the structure of the fountain or water body representation system, including the number of jets, the graphical effect of the water, and the geometry of each effect.</p>

<p>When installing the device, determine the direction in which the lighting device is projected so that the light source is not directly visible or indirectly seen due to reflections and refractions. The gas-filled body should be illuminated from the bottom and the smooth body of water should be illuminated from the front. It is necessary to ensure that the lighting effect of the fountain is visible from all directions. When a separate jet is used to create a vertically upward pattern, at least two fixtures are used. When more jets are used to create water droplets, at least one light is required under each head.</p>
<p>Secondly, With water lighting you are focusing on the beauty of the flowing water. One way to accentuate the movement is to install different light fixtures at various heights. For example, if most of the lighting you currently have is recessed lighting, try to use submersible fountain lights to help the light direction move in different directions. Submersible lights give off ambient light that reflects off the water. It can even light the water as it drips slowly into a basin below.</p>
