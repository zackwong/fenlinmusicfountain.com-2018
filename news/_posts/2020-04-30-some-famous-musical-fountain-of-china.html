<p> It is not easy for a builder of musical fountains to build a perfect fountain. There are many factors to consider, so today we will also briefly introduce what engineers and designers have overlooked in the process of building a musical fountain, as well as some common misunderstandings.</p>
<p>1.Blindly pursue the fictitious names such as "the highest spray" and "Asia first".</p>
<p>Generally, fountains are built in public places such as squares and parks. The wind is relatively large. The fountain is too high. When the wind blows, the pedestrians are sprinkled with water, which makes the square and the front of the store wet. Not only does it have no good effect, but it will affect the user experience.</p>
<p> 2.The nozzle is too dense or too sparse</p>
<p>This usually happens in inexperienced companies. If the nozzle is too dense, it will appear too chaotic, if the nozzle is too sparse, it will appear sparse.</p>
<p>3.The conditions such as hydrology, address and building are not well considered.</p>
<p>The fountain built in the sea must pay attention to the anti-corrosion of the equipment. The fountain built in the river should pay attention to preventing siltation. Also consider the effects of aquatic organisms and so on. Never put the fountain on it. In some places, the performance of the fountain is not good, so it will not be used for a long time. Plants in the water cover the entire fountain structure, and many small animals have multiplied the pipes as nests.</p>
<p>4.The script is monotonous.</p>
<p>Only a few movements can be done in a day, and it has not been closed to the music beat. On the one hand, some companies have the ability of construction but not the ability of rehearsal (because this requires the recruitment of a group of artists and professional scoring software, which is not sold in the real scoring software market. All develop their own software for their own use). On the other hand, arranging actions specifically for music will charge a certain service fee, because this is also an art work, and some companies have been found to be infringing. Investors sometimes "change soups and medicines" to save some money. Of course, the effect is not as good as other places.</p>
<p>5.The fountain platform cannot be raised and lowered.</p>
<p>The fountain platform can not be raised and lowered. When the water level is low, a pile of steel pipes stands staggered there, which is extremely ugly.</p>
<p>6.There is no dedicated viewing platform or the design of the viewing platform is unreasonable.</p>
<p>The best angle to admire the fountain is -30 ° to -50 °, so that you can enjoy the plane composition and three-dimensional sense of the fountain. There is no sense of depth when you look at the shore.</p>
<p>7.The post-maintenance is not enough, not paying attention to the company's brand image, and focusing only on immediate interests.</p>
