<p>Q. How did ornamental water <a href="{{ site.url }}" target="_blank">musical fountains</a> work before the availability of electricity or even steam engines to run the pumps?</p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="/images/news/{{ page.image }}-1.jpg" alt="{{ page.keywords }}"></p>
<p>A Beginning in ancient times, fountain designers relied on gravity, channeling water from a higher source in a closed system to provide pressure.</p>
<p>The aqueducts of ancient Rome carried water down from the mountains to elevated cisterns to be distributed through pipes for both drinking and ornamental purposes.</p>
<p>Just a few feet of elevation could provide enough water pressure for a satisfactory fountain spurt. Even comparatively primitive societies enjoyed such fountains, and recent research suggests the Maya may have done so.</p>
<p>At Versailles, the fountain complex ordered by King Louis XIVused a vast, complicated and highly expensive system of 14 huge wheels, each more than 30 feet in diameter, powered by the current of a branch of the river Seine. A river current is just another manifestation of the power of gravity.</p>
<p>The wheels ran pistons for more than 200 water pumps. Two elevated reservoirs were filled by the pumps, which had leather sealing gaskets.</p>
<p>The Versailles system was called the Machine of Marly, after a smaller royal chateau that also used it when the Sun King did not require a showy display at Versailles.</p>
<p>The cumbersome and inefficient machine worked for well over a century, and vestiges survived into the age of steam, but most of it had disappeared by the 1970s.</p>
