<p>What materials are outdoor water fountains made of? Outdoor fountains are made from various materials. Some outdoor water fountains are made of stainless steel, which is a tough and corrosion-resistant material. Some outdoor water fountains are made of cast stone, which is a durable and light material. Another outdoor water fountain option is ceramic, but outdoor fountains can also be made from wood, other metals, and rocks.</p>
<p>Where can I put an outdoor water fountain? Outdoor water fountains can be placed in the center of a large yard or you can place them near patio furniture so you can relax to the sound of flowing water. If you live in a high-rise, a smaller outdoor fountain that is self-contained lets you enjoy the same outdoor luxuries. Additionally, outdoor <a href="{{ site.url }}">musical fountains</a> are perfect for those looking to add to the foundation of their home or dividing structure, such as a wooden fence.</p>
