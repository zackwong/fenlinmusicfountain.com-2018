<p>1. Artistic Language of Music Fountain</p>
<p>Music is the use of the length of syllables and timbre on one-dimensional timeline to complete the author's expression; painting is the use of dots, light and shade, color, image composition and other modeling methods to shape the image on the two-dimensional plane to achieve aesthetic Effect; sculpture is a three-dimensional space art, using symbolic space modeling to convey the sculptor's ideological connotation; dance tells the story with human body movements, there is time continuation, and there is space movement modeling; fountain and dance Similarly, in the continuation of time, a unique combination of water, point, line, surface, and body forms a unique artistic conception.</p>
<p>As a three-dimensional and dynamic scene, the musical fountain combines the expression methods of various art forms such as music, sculpture, lighting colors and even dances. The orientation and the full angle of view reflect the connotation of music and form a unique aesthetic effect. Here we summarize the language elements of a musical fountain: the type of fountain, the movement form of the fountain, and the color of lights.</p>
<p>One of the language elements of musical fountains: types of fountains. At present, there are many types of fountains. These different types of fountains are one of the indispensable factors that constitute the art of musical fountains. The water jets from these different types of fountains are tall, short, direct, projectile, stout, slender, still, and swinging.Different water types have different artistic characteristics. These different types of fountain water types are like musical notes, which can form a variety of changes to apply different music and form a complete musical fountain work.</p>
<p>The second language element of the musical fountain: action form.The artistic effect of the musical fountain is always presented in the change of the water type of the fountain. The movement, change or existence of the fountain during the running process is the movement form of the fountain. The art of three-dimensional space is static, and only enters into the four-dimensional field if it is carried out over time, it is dynamic.</p>
<p>Here, we summarize the movement forms of musical fountains as stillness, rotation, impact, swing, throwing, running, and changes in fountain types.</p>
<p>The third language element of musical fountain: lighting color. The use of various lights makes the colorless water body change in different colors. This includes underwater lights, computer lights, lasers, etc. The use of lighting breaks through the shape and combination of water in traditional fountains. The color rendering and changes brought by the light greatly enriched the artistic expression of the fountain. It can be seen that the color change is a decisive component of the fountain art.</p>
<p>The application of lighting is mainly used to brighten the water type and render colors to create an artistic conception. Different colors and sensitive changes have different visual feelings. Determine the color and sensitivity changes of the light according to the music, and determine the main color of the light according to the emotion of the music.</p>

<p>In the musical fountain, colors, spring types, and movement forms work together, or enhance or neutralize or embellish or render, which plays an important role in promoting the artistic expression of the fountain works. These three parts of the artistic language are not isolated and stand alone. In all musical fountain works, these artistic languages are always organically combined to complement each other and jointly shape the artistic theme of the musical fountain.</p>
<p>2. Music Analysis</p>
<p>The ideological content and artistic beauty of a music work can only be expressed through the combination of basic elements such as harmony, melody, rhythm, etc., giving people an auditory enjoyment and melting people's aesthetic interest. If you want to use the fountain to interpret music works well, you must understand the music works well.</p>
<p>The focus of the analysis of musical works includes various elements of musical language-melody, beat, rhythm, timbre, tonality, mode, harmony, structure, texture, orchestration, mood, artistic conception, etc .; there are both formal elements and Content elements.</p>
<p>The key points of music analysis in the music fountain are music theme analysis, music rhythm analysis, music structure analysis, and music melody analysis.Music theme analysis: music emotion, music creation background .Musical rhythm analysis: fast, slow, strong, weak. Analysis of the structure of music: Inheritance and transition between sections.Melody analysis of music: the main melody, the core of the music.Music is the soul of fountain, fountain is the echo of music, and melody is the best embodiment of music. Music not only provides a rhythm foundation for the choreographer, but also provides emotions, thoughts, personality, image and structure. The joy of in-depth understanding of the music choreographer will give birth to inexhaustible inspiration, so that the image of the music and the image of the fountain merge As a whole, the "melody of the fountain" is created according to the melody of the music; the change of the color of the music is an inspiration to the diversification of the fountain. The musical structure of the music should be reflected in the structure of the fountain. In the movement, the fountain has reached the effect of ups and downs with the contrast and expansion of music.</p>
<p>3. Performance arrangement</p>
<p>When people experience various sounds, they will unconsciously associate these auditory feelings with the feelings of other non-auditory organs. This phenomenon is called synesthesia. In general, notes in the high range are often associated with bright visual sensations, positive or happy modal feelings, and notes in the low range are often associated with dim visual sensations, depressed or sad modal feelings; soothing The rhythm makes people feel the open space or calmer emotions, while the rapid rhythm makes people feel narrow space, emotional agitation and so on. The arrangement of fountain tracks is to configure various water types according to synesthesia imagination, to interpret a music rhythm, melody, emotion, artistic conception, from hearing to visual image. The arranger of the fountain track needs to control and grasp many objective things such as music, equipment performance, control methods, etc., and have a good artistic creation concept to ensure the rich connotation and full life of the fountain show. The arrangement of fountain tracks is like choreographing a dance. The director needs to consider what kind of posture the dancers use to express the emotion of music. The arrangement of fountain tracks needs to consider what kind of water type changes to express the emotion of music. Colleagues also It is necessary to take into account the unique beauty of the changes in the shape of the fountain itself.</p>
<p>Here, from the perspective of the arranger of the fountain track, we will talk about the water-type movements, content ideology, dance beauty, artistic conception and other factors in the process of arranging the fountain track, so as to better reflect the uniqueness of the music fountain.</p>
