<p>There's nothing quite like an outdoor fountain to bring instant bliss to your space. The sight and sound of moving water add serenity that sets the tone for your outdoors. We've put together this quick guide to help you find the ideal <a href="https://www.fenlinmusicfountain.com/"target="_blank">musical fountain</a> for your home and garden.</p>

<p>What are popular types of fountains?</p>
<p>With the wide variety of fountain styles and sizes available, you're sure to find the ideal choice no matter if you have a tiny balcony or a large yard. If this is your first time shopping for garden fountains, you might not be 100% sure what to look for. Four popular fountains to consider include:</p>
<p>Tiered fountains give your outdoor space a classic look. They've been used in Mediterranean countries for centuries, where they dress up plazas and courtyards.
Self-contained fountains are popular because they include everything you need to be wrapped up in one package, including the plumping, pump and filter. These are particularly well suited for fast installation since they don't need any extra plumbing or water connections.</p>
<p>Disappearing fountains have a hidden reservoir buried underground, which is usually under a layer of rocks or gravel. This provides the illusion that the water cascading from this fun fountain disappears. It takes up minimal space, making it suitable for even tiny spaces.</p>
<p>Wall fountains dress up your patio or courtyard without taking up any space on the ground. Because you integrate or hang these fountains on a new or existing wall, this fountain brings your landscape features together, giving your space a cohesive look.</p>

<p>What are common fountain materials?</p>
<p>Outdoor fountains come in many shapes and sizes. They're also made out of a variety of materials:</p>
<p>Cast stone: Lighter than granite and very durable; gives you a wide range of options in shape and style if you're looking for a more unique design.</p>
<p>Copper: Adds a pop of color and elegance; ideal if you want something warmer looking or aren't a fan of more traditional stone.</p>
<p>Metal: Creates a modern look and lasts longer; like copper, this is a textural alternative if you don't prefer stone, and it holds up well in inclement weather.</p>
<p>Bamboo: Provides exotic flair and a natural look; consider a varnished option that'll hold up better when exposed to moisture.</p>
<p>Fiberglass and Resin: Lightweight but often finished to look like heavy metals or stone; ideal if you want the option to move it to a different spot in the future.</p>

<p>What kind of power source do I need?</p>
<p>When it comes to powering up your new fountain, you have two basic choices: electric and solar. Electric fountains may be hardwired or require access to an electrical outlet. You get reliable performance, but you may need a professional electrician to help with installation. If you'd rather skip calling the electrician or if you're looking for more portability, a solar fountain is a good choice.</p>

<p>How do I maintain my outdoor fountain?</p>
<p>Always read the manufacturer's instructions for the care of your specific fountain. Some general tips include keeping your fountain at the right water level, treating the water to prevent algae, and cleaning the fountain regularly with a fountain cleaner to prevent dirt and debris from accumulating. If you live in a region prone to cold winters, drain the water from the fountain and bring it indoors or place a fountain cover on it before the first freeze.</p>
