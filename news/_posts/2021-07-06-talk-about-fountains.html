<p>Fountain is a natural landscape, which is the ground outcrop of confined water. Fountains in gardens are usually decorative water spraying devices built artificially for the purpose of landscaping. Fountains can moisten the surrounding air, reduce dust and lower the temperature. The tiny water droplets of fountain collide with air molecules, which can produce a large number of negative oxygen ions. Therefore, fountains are conducive to improving the city appearance and enhancing the physical and mental health of residents. The principle of fountain is a conservation of momentum. From a large radius pipe to a small radius pipe, there is a change of velocity, and it rushes away from the ground.</p>
