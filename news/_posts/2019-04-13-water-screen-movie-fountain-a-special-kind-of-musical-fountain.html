<p>Disadvantage</p>
<p>The cost is too high</p>
<p>Small vertical curtains may cost the least, but the imaging range is too small, meaning little. The largest, Singapore, fixed water curtain landscape film, is reported to have invested more than 130 million Singapore dollars; domestically held, medium-sized water Curtain landscape, generally invested in more than 20 million yuan; large, single, laser-effect water curtain performance, it is reported that the investment is also more than 10 million yuan. Electricity, water, site fees, personnel costs, etc. It is like burning money, and the maintenance cost is very high.</p>
<p>Site restrictions</p>
<p>Can only be used in very open areas, outdoor areas, pools, lakes, rivers, rivers, seaside, or squares that provide excellent water supply, drainage systems, etc.</p>
<p>Time limit</p>
<p>Seasons, the climate has a great impact.

Some weather changes will also Unpredictable effects on water curtain movies, such as heavy rain, heavy fog, wind, lightning, hail, etc.</p>
<p>Technical restrictions</p>
<p>Many hardware devices need to be imported, and there are many technical limitations. Taking the three-dimensional plane water curtain as an example, the power of the ultra-high pressure water pump is limited, and the spray height from bottom to top is limited; the picture is huge, playing video and other dynamic pictures, for large engineering projectors. High brightness requirements; super long and wide screen, stitching fusion technology, etc.</p>
<p>Rough picture</p>
<p>Due to the reason of the format, the brightness of the light is not high, the water medium is not flat, etc., the water curtain generally only looks at the macroscopic scene, and does not demand detailed performance. To say simple, it is to see the painting on the line, color, clarity, exquisite, etc. are not picky.</p>
<p>Basic requirements</p>
<p>1. Water curtain movies should be set up with resources close to water, such as rivers, lakes, artificial ponds, large water, etc.</p>
<p>2. The water curtain movie should be where the wind is rising outdoors or at night, in a place where the wind is not big.</p>
<p>3. The water curtain generator should have a high head, low flow, and even a spray, so that more water in the scalloped surface can withstand 3 winds.</p>

The advantage is that the scene is the biggest, the disadvantage is that the capital investment is amazing, the maintenance cost is high in the later period. Generally, it is a temporary performance, and the fixation is relatively small. Since the screen is a transparent water film, the image is in the image. There is a special optical perspective effect during playback, the presented picture has a three-dimensional effect, close to the holographic effect, and the audience is more physically present.</p>
<p>Water surface</p>
<p>Generally, it is directly projected on the lake surface, the pool surface, or the side of the glass wall filled with water. The advantage is that the effect is relatively good, the disadvantage is that the venue is too special and the audience is relatively small.</p>
