<p>When facing the design of a Control Panel for a cybernetic fountain, we must start by choosing between the DMX or PLC technology.</p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="/images/news/{{ page.image }}-1.jpg" alt="{{ page.keywords }}"></p>
<p><a href="{{ site.url }}" target="_blank">Musical fountain</a>: we will always use the DMX protocol by integrating a computer (or tablet PC) in the Control Panel. DMX512, often shortened to DMX (Digital MultipleX) is an electronic protocol used in lighting technologies to control shows lighting, allowing communication between the lights control equipment and light sources. For <a href="{{ site.url }}" target="_blank">musical fountains</a>, we use the DMX protocol and specific software that we can integrate the musical choreography with water features and lights.</p>
<p>1.Interactive fountain without music: depending on the complexity of the project we may use the PLC or DMX protocol. Usually we resort to DMX protocol to control a large number of elements used independently and to PLC in cases where there are more physical groupings of common elements.</p>

<p>To develop the 3D video of your project we will need following information</p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="/images/news/{{ page.image }}-3.jpg" alt="{{ page.keywords }}"></p>
<p>Pictures of the location where the musical fountain will be built. You can always virtualize the dancing fountain in 3D without including a background, but no doubt that adding the location of the fountain will give more realism to dancing fountain 3D video.</p>
<p>It needed for the musical choreography. For a musical fountain we need you to provide us a song that does not exceed 2 minutes. In those cases where the cybernetic fountain doesn't have music, we obviously don't need any song.</p>
