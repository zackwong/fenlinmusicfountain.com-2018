<p>Fountain pumps are also known as recirculating pumps. This means the use the same water over and over again so you can keep them running without worrying about running up the water bill or feeling guilty for wasting excessive water.</p>
<p>There are a few things to consider when choosing a fountain pump. When deciding which is the right one for you, it’s always important to keep in mind how you’re going to use it. Different applications have different needs.</p>

<p>Solar Power Pumps</p>
<p>The most important thing to consider if you’re choosing a fountain pump for an outdoor water feature is how you want to power it. For pumps that are only going to be used outside, solar power is a convenient choice.
A lot of pumps that are designed to create fountains in pools, ponds, and birdbaths feature a nozzle surrounded by a large solar panel that sits near the surface of the water. Others use a separate solar panel with cables that attach to the nozzle. They don’t require an additional power source.Some solar pumps don’t store energy and will only work when the solar panel is exposed to bright sunlight. Others have an internal battery that gives the pump a little more power and keeps it going when clouds block out the sun.</p>

<p>Submersible Water Pumps</p>
<p>For something more powerful and reliable, consider a submersible pump. They can be used indoors and outdoors and, as the name suggests, are completely submersible. This means they can also be used in aquariums to circulate and oxygenate the water.</p>
<p>Submersible pumps are electric and plug right into an outlet. Because they don’t depend on sunlight, they’re consistently powerful and work around the clock.</p>

<p>Water Jets</p>
<p>How high do you want the water to spray? There are two factors that determine how high the spray can get: the volume of water in the pool or fountain and how much water pressure is needed to achieve that height.
Each of these pumps has a different maximum spray height but it’s important to remember that this isn’t the only factor in how high the spray will actually be. Choosing a pump that fits the size of your pool, fountain, or birdbath can help it operate more effectively.</p>
