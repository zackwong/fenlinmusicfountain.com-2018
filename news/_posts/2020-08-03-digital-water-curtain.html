From a practical point of view, water energy gives life to the urban landscape and plays a finishing touch. With lighting and music, water gives it a unique charm and soul, and has immortal vitality! The principle of the water curtain is to input water from the bottom reservoir through a water pump (which is roughly divided into submersible pumps and centrifugal pumps. Generally, silent submersible pumps are used. Centrifugal pumps must have a room, because the motor generates strong noise when starting). The top reservoir, and then along the background wall, or water curtain sprinkler spray or wire, transport the water from the height down. Under the background of lights, the water falls freely from top to bottom along the wall or jet stream. The sparkling dynamic water is like a silver wave, which makes people look beautiful and generous, feels new, and makes people look bright and refreshing feeling of it !</p>
<p>1. Suspended water curtain</p>
<p>Hanging line water curtain, also known as pull line water curtain, uses thin transparent silica gel as the medium to guide the water flow down. Due to the existence of the medium, even if it flows down from a high place, it will not fall into the bottom of the pool. Splashing, you can also combine lighting to present different feelings. Of course, the role of the earth's gravity, the higher the water curtain, the greater the degree of difficulty. The verticality of each wire must be quite accurate, and the distance between the wire and the nozzle aperture must be matched seamlessly! Because it is a linear water curtain, the densely arranged design of the thread can also have different effects.</p>

<p>3. Water curtain wall</p>
<p>Water curtain wall is the most traditional form of water curtain, also known as overflow wall. The flowing water medium is the wall. The wall is generally made of granite marble and laminated glass, or steel mesh. Due to the limited maximum size of the whole glass, hooks are needed in the joints. And sealant, the intervention of these materials will cause the water to dive when passing through these uneven materials, which greatly affects the effect of flowing water. Therefore, the glass wall is only suitable for small water curtain walls, and large water curtain walls are selected. Granite and steel mesh. The most successful case of using steel mesh as a flowing water medium is the Shanghai K11 Atrium Water Curtain. The water curtain is located in the atrium plaza of a large shopping mall. There are still differential factors for the occlusion of the four walls. Gu uses a special 304 stainless steel mesh as the water curtain mediator. The three-dimensional mesh weave increases the water absorption, making the water curtain better under the influence of breeze. complete!</p>
