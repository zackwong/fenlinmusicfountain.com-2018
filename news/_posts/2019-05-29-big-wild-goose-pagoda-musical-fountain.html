There were 318 seats in the guardrail, and the cost was 30 yuan per person. It is understood that the Big Wild Goose Pagoda Musical Fountain has been opened to tourists free of charge since its completion in 2003, attracting a large number of tourists every year. After the addition of the viewing platform, the public was heated up. It was considered that the scenic spot occupied the seat at the most favorable position for watching the fountain. It was a disguised fee, and a fountain performance was only 20 minutes. The charge was too "small family". </p>

When watching the fountain, because of the large amount of water and high water spray, pay attention to protect the electronic products such as cameras to avoid being wet by water mist; children, pregnant women, the elderly and even adults should not be too close to the fountain spout when watching the fountain. Because the instantaneous impact of the fountain water is huge, you should prevent injuries!</p>

<p>>Time choice: evening wind, cool summer, in the big wild goose pagoda that is about to enter the summer, the music fountain at night is beautiful and dynamic. The surging water column is like a slender girl, dancing under the accompaniment of music. So, the best time to watch the fountain is at 8:30 in the night, and only once in the evening. So, at the right time, you can meet the most spectacular scenery.</p>
<p>Location selection: There are a lot of tourists from all over the country, because the square is relatively large. So, a good location means you can watch the panorama. The entire musical fountain lasts for 20 minutes. So, first select the position of the red in the figure. The angle and position can be changed later.</p>
<p> Line: You can take the bus when you go, there is no subway to get there. When you return, try not to take the bus. When you return, you have a lot of people. So, when you return, try to walk as many as you can and then choose to ride.</p>
<p>Usually twice a day, not necessarily catching up, Saturday and Sunday (including holidays) five times a day is: 12:00 14:00 16:00 18:00 20:30, the best thing is at night.</p>
