<p>Outdoor water curtain wall practice: The most common and common water curtain wall is the kind of water curtain wall in the park. This kind of water curtain fountain will give people a feeling of a waterfall, and it will be a little spectacular. Of course, water curtain suppliers say,  whoever can use it indoors now depends on how it is designed.</p>
<p>The practice of indoor water curtain wall group one: If the indoor water curtain wall is designed, we need to pay attention to that the water does not stay and can not splash everywhere, so some indoor water curtain walls will choose two sides of the glass, with a fishing line in the middle, plus a small water pump and a number of tubes.</p>
<p>The second method of indoor water curtain wall group: only one glass is used, plus a small water pump. Then use a tube to pump the water to the upper end of the glass (the upper end of the glass uses a small aluminum alloy bar as a small platform for water to flow down), and the water flows down the glass.</p>
