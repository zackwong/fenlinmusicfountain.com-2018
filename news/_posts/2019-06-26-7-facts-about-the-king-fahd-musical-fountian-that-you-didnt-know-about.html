<p>The King Fahd Fountain has become a landmark that is the perfect postcard for Jeddah. So much so that Jeddah would feel incomplete without it.</p>
<p align="center"><img class="img-responsive" src="/images/news/{{ page.image }}-1.jpg" alt="{{ page.keywords }}"></p>
<p>1- The King Fahd’s Fountain is the tallest <a href="{{ site.url }}">musical fountain</a> in the world by a distance.</p> 
<p>Reaching a height of about 312 meters (1,024 feet) as per some estimates.</p>
<p>Making it taller than the Eiffel Tower (including the antenna).</p>
<p>2- The second-tallest is the Gateway Geyser in East St. Louis, Illinois, USA.  The height of which  reaches about 192 meters (630 feet).</p>
<p>Almost half of the King Fahd Fountain’s height.</p>
<p>3- The construction on the mammoth landmark began in the early 80’s.</p>
The Fountain as it stands today began operating in 1985.</p>
<p>4- It was built in a similar style to the Jet d’Eau fountain in Geneva (Switzerland).
<p>Jet d’Eau is Geneva’s most famous landmark.</p>
<p>5- The water of the Jeddah’s collosal fountain consists of a  massive plume of water shooting vertically into the air at a speed of around 233 miles per hour.
The airborne mass of can exceed 16,000 kg.</p>
<p>6- Because Jeddah’s Fountain operates using sea water running at unusually high speeds; corrosion and abrasion were key challenges to the builders.</p>
<p>Thus the intakes for the pumps are in a special pit that is continually pumped dry and treated annually with anti-fouling paint that prevents growth of marine life.</p>
<p>The water is passed through a series of screens before it reaches the pumps, filtering out soil, sand, and organic matter.</p>
<p>7- Over 500 high-intensity spotlights are used to illuminate the fountain at night.</p>
<p>They were specially designed to withstand the constant barrage of thousands of tons of water falling from several hundred feet.</p>
<p>The only time the <a href="{{ site.url }}">musical fountain</a> is shut down is for a time period exceeding a day is during its annual planned maintenance.</p>
<p>This takes about three weeks.</p>
