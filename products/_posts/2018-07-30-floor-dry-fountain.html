  <h4>Water park floor dry fountain introduce</h4>
  <p>Floor(Dry) Water Fountains are installed underground, with satin and beautiful stone surface, which could have thousands of design and sculpt on it. When music is playing, beads of water spray from the underground and flutter in the air. Under the light's irradiation, the ground shins like a mirror, which takes visitors' breath. When music stopped, everything returns to original peace.</p>
  <p>The applicable type of this fountain could be both Musical Fountain and Program Controlling Fountain.</p>
  <p>Since the Floor Water Fountains are installed under ground, they do not impact traffic or passerby's walking when stop, so they are applicable to hotel, restaurant, department store, office tower, street scene, uptown and so on.</p>
