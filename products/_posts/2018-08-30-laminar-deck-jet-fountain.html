<h4>Rainbow laminar flow fountains features:</h4>
<p>• Water arcs reach up to 3m high and project out six feet into your pool, spa, or other water feature.</p>
<p>• Installation is made flush to your deck or other surface; no unsightly or unsafe edges, just the magic of water erupting from a hidden source.</p>
<p>• Nighttime color effects include the ability to hold a steady color or control through a range of available colors.</p>
<p>A Serial, color-changing LED lighting system is at the heart of the Lightbender Laminar. It has a variety of distinct programs—synchronized, random, party and can freeze on a single color.</p>
<p>Lightbender Laminar create totally clear, uniform arcs of moving water that originate from either your pool deck or surrounding landscape. At night, these translucent streams are brilliantly colored with an LED light source. The result is a water effect that adds an elegant bit of entertainment to your poolscape.</p>
