  <h4>Introduce of big hoolow jets</h4>
  <p>Water column stout and tall, imposing high pressure jet, commonly used in the center of the large pool and a large area of the lake, through a specially configuration designed and pumps reach up to a height of 50-100 meters above.</p>
  <p>Easy installation: it only requires tubing and a submergible water pump.</p>
  <p>The performance of all fountain spray heads is directly affected by the total HP pumped through the fountain nozzle head. For a higher and wider spray pattern in your pond, a higher power of water pump is required.</p>
  <p>We mainly use Stainless Steel 304 materials to produce the fountain nozzles which with thick thickness guarantee its high quality and smooth crystal water jetting. We use also use cooper material based on your requirement.</p>
