  <p>Wire water curtains is completely different from that of water walls. This fountains are composed of a series of vertical wires made of a synthetic material named mylar. The wires are flat and remain in a vertical parallel disposition, creating a fine continuous surface. Each wire is connected to a small nozzle located on top of the wall: this nozzle feeds the wires with water that flows into droplets. The droplets slide on the wire until they reach the bottom pond, creating a constant and regular flow.</p>
  <p>String Water Curtain Fountains comprises M10 nozzle and strip of plastic wire, along which the water runs under the effect of gravity from the outlet to the fountain pond. .A counterweight is fitted at the end of the plastic sheet so that the thread is taut at all times.
