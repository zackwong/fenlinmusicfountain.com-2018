<p>The earliest known <a href="https://www.fenlinmusicfountain.com/"target="_blank">musical fountains</a> were described by Hero of Alexandria in his book Pneumatics dating back to the first century AD. The primitive musical fountains were totally different in the sense that the flowing water was used to produce music from musical instruments. For example, a resonating column with constantly changing water level disturbing the harmonic frequencies periodically, Water trumpets. Modern-day fountains employ a computer controlled pneumatic arrangements, essentially a pressurized cylinder of water with the provision of an expulsion mechanism(like a piston) and a nozzle at the outlet that is programmed to squirt water with a specific force for a specific duration while the computer also manages the audio output.</p>

<p>The musical fountain's history is somewhat vague. I believe, it gradually grew over time and got separated from the musical instruments with artists timing their notes with the water flow or the fountain being manually timed with the music or a combination of both with the artists carefully rehearsing their performance with both the instruments and the fountain.</p>
<p>The circulation system is also modernized with the help of pressure sensors and pumps to maintain continuity. Old school fountains used the principle of siphoning to maintain continuity where the water level was maintained slightly above the height of the canons that squirted water such that any drop in water level resulted in a siphoning suction being established at the canon's mouth.</p>
<p>This is no longer a reliable option on account of the inside of the canon being pressurized by the pneumatic system and usually, this pressure is higher than the pressure at the outlet. Hence we started using pumps. Note here that the pumps need not necessarily be hooked up to the computer.</p>
<p>The expulsion is a simple procedure with the water being forced out of the nozzle by compressing the fluid inside the canon.</p>

<p>The present-day fountains employ solenoid valves rather than pneumatic cylinders. The pressure for the expulsion of water is computed beforehand and this value is translated in terms of current and is fed to the solenoid through an electronic circuit from the computer. The current through the solenoid determines the magnitude of the valve opening. This might be thought of being analogous to a graphic equalizer on your music system. The opening and closing of valves ensure the pressure inside the canons and is tremendously rapid. The current is, usually dependent on the frequency of the note being played.</p>
<p>Usually, lights are used to frame the fountain and the trajectories of water intended to impress the audience against a dark backdrop. They also help to a certain level to lend a psychedelic feel to the show and hold the audience transfixed for some duration. These lights can be operated manually or again computerized if many shows have to be done continuously.</p>
<p>The most well known musical fountain is perhaps the one at the Bellagio Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas.</p>
